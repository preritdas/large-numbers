# Law of Large Numbers Simulator

The app is live [here](http://largenumbers.preritdas.com).

The `style/` folder contains the deployment's `CSS` style file to remove footers, and ensures the elements mesh well together. `app.py` contains the source code and is the execution file. `Procfile` is a script used by the server to initiate itself upon deployment. `requirements.txt` contains all necessary modules and dependencies in order to re-deploy the app. `runtime.txt` contains the preferred Python version `3.8.12` so the server knows which version to instantiate on deployment. `setup.sh` is a bash script that configures and readies the server for deployment.
